# Let's Have A Look At Some Graphs! 

## Graph 1: State Mentions in Congressperson's Tweets on 10/01/2017

The graph below uses this [data set](https://data.world/socialmediadata/tweets-of-congress-october/workspace/file?filename=2017-10-01.json) to demonstrate how many times the states California, New York, Texas, DC, and Florida were mentioned by Congresspeople in their tweets on a single day in October, 2017. The reason I chose to make this graph was to find out which of these oft mentioned states was going through controversy during this period of time. As demonstrated below, Florida was the most mentioned state, followed closely by California. The lowest number of mentions was surprisingly New York.

## Graph 2: Percentages of Male and Female Congresspeople

The graph below uses [data set 1](https://data.world/socialmediadata/tweets-of-congress-october/workspace/file?filename=2017-10-01.json) and [data set 2]() to show the stark gender differences in both houses of Congress. As expected, there is very little doubt that the percent of females relative to the percent of men is very low. This is known data, however, and efforts to increase female representation in Congress are continuing.
